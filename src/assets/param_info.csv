Because the laboratory detection step using internal oligos is 
independent of the PCR amplification procedure, internal oligo 
tags have defaults that are independent of the parameters that 
govern the selection of PCR primers. For example, the melting 
temperature of an oligo used for hybridization might be 
considerably lower than that used as a PCR primer.

Legal values are:

generic

   Design a primer pair (the classic primer3 task) if
   the PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER=1, and
   PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER=1. In addition, pick
   an internal hybridization oligo if 
   PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO=1.
   
   NOTE: If PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER=1, 
   PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER=0 
   and
   PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO=1,
   then behaves similarly to 
   PRIMER_TASK=pick_primer_list.


pick_detection_primers

   Deprecated alias for PRIMER_TASK=generic

check_primers

   Primer3 only checks the primers 
   provided in SEQUENCE_PRIMER, SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO and 
   SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP. It is the only task that does not
   require a sequence. However, if SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE is provided, it is used.
   

pick_primer_list

   Pick all primers in SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE (possibly
   limited by SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION, 
   SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION,
   SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST, etc.).
   Returns the primers sorted by quality starting with the 
   best primers. If PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER and 
   PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER is selected primer3 does not to pick 
   primer pairs but generates independent lists of left primers, right primers,
   and, if requested, internal oligos.

pick_sequencing_primers

   Pick primers suited to sequence a region. SEQUENCE_TARGET can be 
   used to indicate several targets. The position of each primer is 
   calculated for optimal sequencing results.

pick_cloning_primers

   Pick primers suited to clone a gene were the start nucleotide and 
   the end nucleotide of the PCR fragment must be fixed, for example 
   to clone an ORF. SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION must be used to 
   indicate the first and the last nucleotide. Due to these 
   limitations primer3 can only vary the length of the primers. Set 
   PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY=1 to obtain primers even if they violate 
   specific constraints.

pick_discriminative_primers

   Pick primers suited to select primers which bind with their end at 
   a specific position. This can be used to force the end of a primer 
   to a polymorphic site, with the goal of discriminating between
   sequence variants. SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION must be used to 
   indicate the last nucleotide of the left (first nucleotide of 
   included region) and the right primer (last nucleotide of 
   included region). Due to these limitations primer3 can only vary 
   the length of the primers. Set PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY=1 to obtain 
   primers even if they violate specific constraints.

template, 0.025 units/microliter Taq polymerase in 0.1 mM each

cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 degrees Celsius.

The value of this parameter is less than the actual
concentration of oligos in the initial reaction mix because it is the
concentration of annealing oligos, which in turn depends on the
amount of template (including PCR product) in a given cycle.
This concentration increases a great deal during a PCR;
fortunately PCR seems quite robust for a variety of oligo melting

PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END tries to bind the 3'-END to a identical primer

primer quality because it allows primers use itself as a target

are then unable to bind and amplify the target sequence.
PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END is the maximum allowable 3'-anchored global 
alignment score when testing a single primer for 
self-complementarity. The 3'-anchored global alignment score

argument. In the examples above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00

FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp
2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this
file below.  If this parameter is specified then primer3 locally
aligns each candidate primer against each library sequence and
rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a
specified weight (see below) exceeds PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING.
(The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 100.0.)

Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file must begin with an
""id line"" that starts with '>'.  The contents of the id line is
""slightly restricted"" in that primer3 parses everything after any
optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the
weight mentioned above.  If the id line contains no asterisk then
the weight defaults to 1.0.  The alignment scoring system used is
the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g.
PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY), except for the handling of IUB/IUPAC ambiguity
codes (discussed below).

The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines
following the id line up until a line starting with '>' or
the end of the file.  Whitespace and newlines are ignored.
Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' and
IUB/IUPAC 'ambiguity' codes ('R, 'Y', 'K', 'M', 'S', 'W',
'N', including lower case) are retained. For technical
reasons the length of the sequence must be >= 3. Of course,
sequences of length < 10 or so are probably useless, but

P3_COMMENT,"The value of this tag is ignored. It can be used to annotate input.19. HOW PRIMER3 CALCULATES THE PENALTY VALUE
In essense, the penalty values define what is the best primer
pair.
The calculation of penalty values
takes into consideration penalty weights, which allow
one to fine-tune the selection of primers to specific needs.

This section will explain the selection process of primers by 
primer3. In general the selection is a multi step process:

In the first step, primer3 evaluates every primer that 
can be picked in the region of interest, possibly subject to
constraints due to target regions, product size ranges, and
so forth, that might preclude the use of primers in the
eventually selected primer pairs. In this pass the hard 
limits are tested like PRIMER_MAX_GC or PRIMER_MIN_TM. Primers 
with a GC lower than PRIMER_MAX_GC or a Tm higher than 
PRIMER_MIN_TM are memorized, the primers which fail in one of 
these tests are excluded. Primer3 can be forced to use primers 
failing to pass this test by setting PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY to one 
(only available for primers provided by the user).

In the second step, primer3 calculates a penalty for each
primer. This penalty is the only score by which primer3 
evaluates the primers It is also provided as output 
PRIMER_LEFT_4_PENALTY, PRIMER_INTERNAL_4_PENALTY and 
PRIMER_RIGHT_4_PENALTY (shown for the primer set 4). For each 
primer, it is calculated like that:",string,
